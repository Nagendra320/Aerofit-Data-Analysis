Overview
--------
This repository provides a detailed analysis of Aerofit's treadmill sales data, focusing on customer behavior, demographics, and product choice correlations. The objective is to derive actionable insights to inform product strategy, enhance customer experience, and optimize market positioning.

Repository Contents
-------------------
- **Aerofit_Analysis.ipynb**: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire data analysis lifecycle, including preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and advanced statistical evaluations.
- **aerofit_data.csv**: The dataset that includes detailed transaction records, customer demographics, and treadmill model specifics.
- **README.md**: This document, which outlines the repository's structure and provides guidance on how to effectively utilize the contents.

Analysis Summary
----------------
The analysis is structured into various sections, each targeting essential aspects of the data:
